# RFM-Analysis-Using-SQL
In this project, a sales dataset was explored, and customer segmentation analysis was conducted using SQL and Tableau. The analysis provided insights into various aspects of the sales data, such as sales by product line, sales by year, sales by deal size, the best month for sales per year, and product line sales in the best month. Additionally, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis was applied to segment customers based on their past purchase behavior.
